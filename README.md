# dailymail-archive-scraper
Simple Python script for collecting all article links from dailymail website archive, returns a list of dictionaries. I used this for a personal project analysing the sentiment of news articles.

Requires the lxml package, which can be downloaded here: https://lxml.de/installation.html

Set date period you want at lines 25-26

There is a wait time of 3 seconds for each day, this can be adjusted, but take care not to overload the server!
